# Analysis
Build an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables that will update on a daily basis. This task was accomplished by creating an ETL function to collect and process data from three different sources and formats (JSON, Kaggle metadata, .csv) and adds it to a ProstgreSQL database.
## Project Breakdown:
-Intake 3 data files
-Write an ETL function to read data 
-Extract and transform the data
-Create a final combined Movie Database
